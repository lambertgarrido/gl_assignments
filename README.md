Assignments from great learning course

Learner_Fullcode - Customer segmentation exercise.ipynb: Explored data via descriptive statistics, distribution plots, and box plots. Used k-means clustering to determine customer segments and drew business insights.

Learner Notebook - Full Code Version - Potential Customers Prediction.ipynb: Explored data via descriptive statistics, box plots, bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps. Used random forest classifier to predict customer leads to sales. Searched for optimal set of hyperparameters to find model with best f1 score.

Recommendation_Systems_Learner_Notebook_Full_Code.ipynb: Explored different recommendation models on data containing ratings on user-item pairs. Evaluated user-user similarity recommendation system and an item-item similiarity recommendation systems, both based on k-nearest neighbors model.  A recommedation system using SVD (singular value decomposition) was also explored. The models were evaluated based on precion, recall, at F1 scores. Grid search hyperparameter tuning was used to find the optimal set of model parameters for each model.
